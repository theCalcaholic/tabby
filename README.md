# Tabby - An easy-to-use tabbed profile editor

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theCalcaholic/tabby/master/img/preview.png)

## Description
This is a little, Angular based single page application which let's you create and export a tab-based html user profile (e.g. for bulletin boards). The editor is WYSIWYD with and uses a simple template and styling engine. The results are HTML + CSS only, no Javascript (which _should hopefully_ be restricted in bboards for security reasons).
